# A comment. This is so you can read your program later
# I get it already, I don't think I need to repeat this
# this is the same as python 

puts "I could have code like this" # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use comments to disable or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run"

puts "Ths will run"
